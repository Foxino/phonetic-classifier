# Sub-Phonetic-Classifier

Live classification of varying degrees of phonmes (sub-phonetic) for lip sync techniques.

For example, /a/ = ahh /a/2 = AHHHH

Needs to be ran on a server, note it WILL train on load, only detecting 2 IPA / split into two levels.Intended for use with RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) but time constraints. :c
